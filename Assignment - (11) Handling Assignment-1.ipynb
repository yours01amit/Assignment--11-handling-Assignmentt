    "Q1. What is an Exception in python? Write the difference between Exceptions and Syntax errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the           normal flow of the program's instructions. In general, when a Python script encounters a situation   that it cannot cope with, it raises an exception. An exception is a Python object that represents an   error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " The main difference between an exception and a syntax error in Python is that a syntax error occurs when the code contains invalid syntax, while an exception occurs when an error occurs during the execution of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "A syntax error is a type of error that occurs when the code violates the rules of the Python language syntax. These errors are typically detected by the Python interpreter during the parsing of the code, before the code is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of syntax errors include misspelled keywords, missing parentheses, or incorrect indentation. Syntax errors prevent the code from being executed, and the Python interpreter displays an error message that describes the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An exception, on the other hand, is an error that occurs during the execution of the program, even if the code is syntactically correct. Exceptions are typically caused by runtime errors or unexpected conditions that the program encounters during execution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of exceptions include division by zero, accessing an undefined variable, or trying to open a file that doesn't exist. When an exception occurs, the program stops executing and raises an exception object that contains information about the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a syntax error occurs during the parsing of the code before the program is executed, while an exception occurs during the execution of the program when an unexpected condition or error occurs."

    "\n",
    "Ans: When an exception is not handled in a Python program, it will cause the program to terminate and an error message will be displayed that describes the type of exception that occurred and the line of code where the exception occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's below an example that demonstrates what happens when an exception is not handled:\n",
    "As we can see from the error message, Python tells us that a ZeroDivisionError occurred and that it was caused by a division by zero on line 1 of the code. The \"Traceback\" section of the error message shows the sequence of function calls that led to the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, if an exception is not handled in a Python program, it will cause the program to terminate and display an error message that describes the type of exception that occurred and the line of code where the exception occurred. It's important to handle exceptions in your code to prevent unexpected program termination and to provide a graceful way to handle errors."
